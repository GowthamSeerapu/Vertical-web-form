# Description
Using Json PowerdB connecting database to HTML.JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database.

Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

Whether it's a Dynamic Website or a Mobile App or some Data Analytics Portal, the development is real fun and fast. Nothing better than trying it yourself. What all you need is a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

Note: Using JsonPowerDB is equally Easy and Fast when used with Server Side programming like Java, .NET, Python or PHP etc.

# Scope of functionalities
Since JSON is used to host/represent data, we will discuss how it is different from the traditional Relational Database model used in RDBMS systems like MySQL, SQL Server etc. This may be useful for you to choose JSON over RDBMS or RDBMS over JSON depending upon the type and structure of data you want to deal with. Let's start with a comparison against certain features:

• Structure : In the relational database, these are tables, which are responsible for storing data in form of rows and columns. JSON uses objects and arrays - objects are label-value pairs and arrays are the list of values. They can be nested recursively.
• Metadata : In a relational database, it is a schema, which is used for storing data about the structure and type of the data to be stored and schemas are predefined, i.e. they are created at the time of creation of database and tables before you can store data. JSON also may use schema, to have a definition of the structure and type of data to represented, but it is not predefined. Most of the time it is self-describing, even if it uses a schema, it comes with much more flexibility than a schema used in relational database. But it would be judgmental to say that it is an advantage of JSON over Relational Database. Having a pre-defined schema may have several benefits depending upon the data to be dealt with.
• Retrieving data : Relational databases use Structured Query Language, an expressive and very powerful language, based on relational algebra to fetch data from the database. JSON does not have any widely used or accepted language to query the data stored. JAQL and JSONiq are many of the query languages which mostly are work in progress to query data from JSON.
• Sorting : SQL does the job in case of Relational Database. In the case of JSON, since arrays often used, in programs, arrays can be sorted.
• Application : There are many open-source as well as commercial Relational Database systems are available - like MySQL, POstgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, DB2 etc. JSON is mostly applied to programming languages. But, there is also NoSQL systems. NoSQL systems use JSON format to store data. Some of the NoSQL systems use JSON format are - MongoDB, CoucheDB etc.
• Learning curve: JSON is a clear winner here. Since the basic data types and structure used here are similar to those used in many programming languages, it is obvious that if you are coming from a programming background, you will pick things up in JSON pretty fast. RDBMS is a separate field of study on the other hand. But definitely, the time you invest in learning Relational database return you several opportunities and benefits.
# Examples of Uses
Append ?format=json-pretty to the URL of any page on your Squarespace site and you'll be able to view the JSON data for the site.
